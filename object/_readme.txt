In this folder, you can insert the icons of future Relics/Ornaments so that they are
loaded into the program like the already existent ones.
It is recommended to use the icons from the HSR wiki (which are the same ones used by
the program) that you can find here:
https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Relic/Sets

To make them recognizable by the program, simply place them in this folder in PNG format,
naming them in lowercase and following this schema:
[parsed_title]_[part].png
Where [parsed_title] refers to the official name of the set, with every character that is
not one of the 26 English alphabet letters removed (excluding numbers) and spaces replaced
with the underscore.
Meanwhile, [part] refers to the type of piece in the set, which can be one
of the following: "main", "head", "hands", "feet", "body", "planar" and "rope".
A couple of examples:
• For the ornament set "Bone Collection's Serene Demesne", you should create the
following images:
    1) bone_collections_serene_demesne_main.png
    2) bone_collections_serene_demesne_planar.png
    3) bone_collections_serene_demesne_rope.png
• For the relic set "Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations", you should create the
following images:
    1) watchmaker_master_of_dream_machinations_main.png
    2) watchmaker_master_of_dream_machinations_head.png
    3) watchmaker_master_of_dream_machinations_hands.png
    4) watchmaker_master_of_dream_machinations_body.png
    5) watchmaker_master_of_dream_machinations_feet.png

Note: please remember that to make the program recognize any new icons, you need to force
a database update using the appropriate function found in the "File" menu of the program.
