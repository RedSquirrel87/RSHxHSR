In this folder, you can insert the icons of future characters so that
they are loaded into the program like the already existent ones.
It is recommended to use the icons from the HSR wiki (which are the
same ones used by the program) that you can find here:
https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Character/List

To make them recognizable by the program, simply place them in this
folder with the exact name used by the program (just start it and see
the character list; those without an icon will appear with only the name,
which is exactly what you need to name the image file!) and with the ".png"
format and extension.

Note: please remember that to make the program recognize any new icons,
you need to force a database update using the appropriate function found
in the "File" menu of the program.
