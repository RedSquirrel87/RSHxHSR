# In this file you can provide the compatibility table between the character names used on game8.co
# (https://game8.co/games/Honkai-Star-Rail/archives/404256), which are the default names acquired and
# displayed by the program, and the corresponding names used in the Google Sheet file
# (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SQK2xihURxiA2PTp0lAiRYXlphnm-EFa3CoKaUO7UOc/view?gid=1312600809)
# for prydwen.gg. This way, the characters' builds data taken from game8 will be integrated with the
# corresponding information of prydwen.gg to have a more complete overview in the program.
#
# Notes:
# 1) Obviously, please write below only the names that are different between those used by game8 and in the
# Google Sheet file for prydwen.gg; identical ones will be automatically recognized by the program, so
# you don't need to enter them here.
# 2) Please remember that to make the program recognize any change in this file you need to force a database
# update using the appropriate function you can find in the "File" menu of the program.
#
# The syntax is as follows:
# [Character's name used on game8.co]->[Character's name used in the Google Sheet file for prydwen.gg]
